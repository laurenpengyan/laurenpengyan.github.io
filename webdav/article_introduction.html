    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
    It is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that allows clients to perform remote Web content authoring
    operations. WebDAV is defined in RFC 4918 by a working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force.</p>
    <p>The WebDAV protocol provides a framework for users to create, change and move documents on a server. The most
    important features of the WebDAV protocol include the maintenance of properties about an author or modification date,
    namespace management, collections, and overwrite protection. Maintenance of properties includes such things as the creation,
    removal, and querying of file information. Namespace management deals with the ability to copy and move web pages
    within a server's namespace. Collections deal with the creation, removal, and listing of various resources. Lastly,
    overwrite protection handles aspects related to locking of files.</p>
