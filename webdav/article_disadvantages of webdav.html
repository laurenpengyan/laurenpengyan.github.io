   <h1>Disadvantages of WebDAV</h1>
   <p>
      WebDav is significantly slow as compared to other methods for file systems and might add security issues if you have to
      protect content through file system and web server both. The locking mechanism mentioned in the previous section is not
      compatible with a file system. Using the filesystem and WebDav together allows two users to change a file
      simultaneously which is not desired behavior. Also, it might require duplicate user management and authentication which
      will make the system slower.</p>

   <p>A malicious file might convince the user to open a perfectly harmless and legitimate file, execute code under the
      context of that user and introduce harmful behavior. Additionally, WebDav cannot act as source control to manage
      different versions of documents. So, an additional content management tool is required. Apart from transfers,
      opening,
      closing and saving of files is also observed to be slow in WebDav.</p>
