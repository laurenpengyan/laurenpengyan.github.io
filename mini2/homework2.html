    <h1>This is the first heading</h1>
    <span class="banner">Welcome</span>
    <p><span class="first-letter"><b><i>T</i></b></span>his is my first paragraph and all the paragraphs in this page
        will start with a bigger font</p>
    <p><span class="first-letter"><b><i>M</i></b></span>y life as a web developer, has been pretty much amazing! I
        started
        developing web pages when there was no CSS to be used and all formatting was done using HTML tags that
        currently
        are considered deprecated or even eliminated from good web developed pages. One example of tags that have been
        eliminated are: <span class="red-text">&lt;font&gt;, &lt;center&gt;</span>. There are some attributes that have
        been
        also eliminated in order to clean more the HTML code and put all the formatting (style) to CSS.</p>
    <h2><i>Using CSS</i>
    </h2>
    <p><span class="first-letter"><b><i>W</i></b></span>hen CSS was created, the main idea was exactly to take all of
        these
        formatting tags and attributes from the HTML document and transfer them to an external file that would only
        take
        care of formatting the HTML page. The idea is that the HTML document should be focused on the content of the
        page
        and the formatting, even layout, would be in a separated file.</p>
    <p><span class="first-letter"><b><i>W</i></b></span>his standard has been supported and adopted world wide by W3C
        (<span class="red-text">World Wide Web Consortium</span>)
        which is the organization that sets the standards for web
        development.</p>
    <h2><i class="end-exercise">End of this exercise</i>
    </h2>
    <p><span class="first-letter"><b><i>A</i></b></span>t the end of this exercise, you will take all of these bad
        attributes and formatting tags that are taking too
        much space in this HTML document and you will create an <span class="red-text">embedded CSS</span> using the
        <span class="red-text">&lt;style&gt; tag</span> (of course, placing this tag in the appropriate section of your
        document). Within that style tag, you will transfer all the formatting you see in this page and create
        appropriate CSS in order to clean the HTML document without changing the formatting that this old style HTML
        has created!</p>
    <p><span class="first-letter"><b><i>T</i></b></span>is a link to <a href="http://www.ccsf.edu">City College web
            site</a>.
        After
        you visit this page, this link should be white due to the vlink attribute in the body tag. If you have never
        visited this link, then, it will be red due to the link attribute in the body tag as well.
