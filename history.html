              <h2>The Yamato Court</h2>
              <p> In the early Stone Age, the Japanese archipelago was connected
                with the Asian continent.People lived by hunting and gathering,
                using crude stone tools. In the Yayoi period, they started rice
                cultivation as a main livelihood and formed local groups. In
                239, Himiko, the queen of Yamatai, governed about 30 local
                groups and sent an envoy to the Kingdom of Wei in China. </p>
              <p> In the late 3rd century, the Yamato Dynasty, centered around
                the emperor, started to expand its presence. Massive kofun
                (tumuli) represents the power it wielded. Afterwards, Prince
                Shotoku and the Emperor Temmu formed a penal and administrative
                system based on the Chinese model. The governing center was
                moved to Asuka, where the Yamato court enjoyed stability.
                Buddhism also started to flourish in this period. </p>

              <h2>The Rise of Samurai Warrior</h2>
              <p>In 710, the government set Japan’s first capital at Heijo-kyo,
                in Nara.Japan first text,"Nihon-shoki,"'"Udoki,"and "Man’yoshu"
                were compiled at that time. In 794, the capital was moved into
                Heian-kyo (now Kyoto). This period is called the"Heian-era ."In
                this period, due to the suspension of exchange with China, a
                unique Japanese culture (Kokufu-bunka) took root. Several key
                works of literatures using hiragana and katakana (both are
                modified from Chinese Character ‘Kanji’), like "The take of
                Genji,"or "The Pillow Book, " were came out. While
                the ruler of central government changed from a regent and a
                chief adviser to the Emperor to a cloistered emperor, a class
                started to emerge. Later, the Heishi clan led by Taira no
                Kiyomori came into power, but was overthrew by Minamoto no
                Yoritomo, the leader of the Genji clan.</p>

              <h2>Samurai Government</h2>

                </div>
                <p> In 1192, after his defeat over the Heike
                  clan, Minamoto no Yoritomo established the first military
                  shogunate at Kamakura. After his death, the Hojo family that
                  served as regents, seized the power. Rround this time Mongol
                  invasions were repelled twice, in 1274 and in 1281. These
                  repelled invasions weakened the government and brought it to
                  an end. </p>
                <p> After the fall of Kamakura government, the Emperor Godaigo
                  came into power, but Takauji, a leader of the Ashikaga clan
                  opposed the Emperor so that the government split into two, one
                  in Kyoto and one in Yoshino. The Ashikaga clan won this
                  dispute and in 1336, Ashikaga Yoshimitsu established the
                  Muromachi shognate. In this period, Noh drama and Kyogen
                  established their style of performance. </p>
                <p>In 1467, the Onin War erupted and ushered the age into
                  continued battles among feudal lords and peasantry. Oda
                  Nobunaga destroyed the Muromachi shognate and set out to unify
                  the nation under his rule. Christianity was introduced in
                  Japan under his patronage. Toyotomi Hideyoshi accomplished the
                  unification of the nation. The era from the Onin War to 1568,
                  when Oda Nobunaga entered into Kyoto, is sometimes called ‘the
                  Warring States period'. </p>
                <p>After Hideyoshi’s death, Tokugawa Ieyasu seized the power
                  through the victory on the Battle of Sekigahara. He
                  established Tokugawa shognate in 1603. The Edo period refers
                  to the time when the Edo shognate served as the government. In
                  this period, the government employed isolationism, breaking
                  off diplomatic relations with foreign countries except for
                  China and Holland. Christianity was also prohibited. </p>
                <p>In 1853, the last years of the Edo period, the Black Ships
                  (Western ships with advanced weaponry) steamed into Japanese
                  port, which put Japan’s isolationism into an end. It also led
                  to the end of Edo shognate. During the period between the
                  Black Ships and the end of Edo shognate is specifically
                  called‘Bakumatsu.’ </p>

                <h2>Modernization</h2>
                <p> After the end of Tokugawa shognate, Japan aimed at
                  modernization and the Imperial Constitution that notes
                  sovereignty rests with the Emperor was promulgated. In 1895,
                  Sino-Japanese War ended with Japan’s victory that allowed
                  Japan to expand its territory to the Riaodong Peninsula and
                  Taiwan, but the Triple Intervention forced to Japan to return
                  the Riaodong Peninsula. Japan entered into war with "the
                  Rossiiskaya Imperiya" (the Rosso-Japanese War) in 1904 but
                  made peace in the end.</p>
                <p> Once the World WarⅠstarted in 1914, Japan joined the war
                  based on the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. After the war, Japan
                  served as one of the permanent members of the League of
                  Nations. </p>

                <p> In 1931, Japan brought about the Manchurian Incident, and
                  occupied Manchuria. The League of Union did not justify the
                  occupation so that in 1933, Japan withdrew from it. </p>
                <p> In 1937, Japan opened a war with the republic of China while
                  joining the World War Ⅱbased on the Tripartite Pact concluded
                  with Germany and Italy. In 1941, Japan headed into the battle
                  of Pacific War. However by 1945, atomic bombs were dropped
                  onto both Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Japan was forced to
                  surrender. </p>
                <p> After the defeat of the war, Japan promulgated the
                  Constitution of Japan was established for Japan, and is based
                  on the sovereignty of people and pacifism. In the subsequent
                  era of high-growth made Japan as the second biggest economy in
                  the world and its economy vastly improved. In the late 20th,
                  however, Japan suffered from the burst of their 'bubble'
                  economy, which caused prolonged stagnation. Only recently the
                  economy has shown a signs of recovery. </p>
                <p> In recent years, several natural disasters and accidents,
                  such as the Great Hanshin Earthquake, the Tokyo subway sarin
                  attack, the Great East Japan Earthquake, and the Fukushima
                  Daichi nuclear disaster Nuclear Power Plant accident, suffered
                  Japan and the sense of a need for risk management is growing
                  among people. </p>
