            <h2 style="text-align: justify">What Is Web.Dev</h2>
            <p><span class="first-letter">W</span>eb.dev is the ultimate resource for developers of all backgrounds to
                learn,
                create, and solve on the web. It's meant to not only educate developers, but help them apply what
                they've learned
                to any site they work on, be it personal or business.</p>
            <h2 style="text-align: center">Where You Can Learn And Measure</h2>

            <p><span class="first-letter">A</span>fter you've launched your site, come back to web.dev and measure how
                well it
                supports your users. If there are areas where it can improve, you'll get immediate steps to increase
                your metrics.
                As the web advances, users' expectations get higher. With web.dev's guidance, you can give your users
                the best
                possible experience, wherever they are!</p>
            <h2 style="text-align: justify"> What I Learnt</h2>
            <img src="ppt.jpeg" alt="ppt" width="250" height="240">
            <p><span class="first-letter">F</span>irst of all, I recoginzed I have to know users, and I have solutions
                for their
                needs. But, to win users' loyalty, I also need to give them the best possible experience with my site.

                <h3>The site principles:</h3>

                <ul>

                    <li>Find your site</li>
                    <li>Open your site from any device</li>
                    <li>Load your site on a poor network connection</li>
                    <li>Use your site with assistive technology, like a screen reader</li>

                </ul> With web.dev, we can see how my website is performing, and learn tips to improve user experience.
