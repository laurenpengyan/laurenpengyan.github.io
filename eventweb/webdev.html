                <h2>What Is Web.Dev</h2>
                <p> Web.dev is the ultimate resource for developers of all backgrounds to
                    learn,
                    create, and solve on the web. It's meant to not only educate developers, but help them apply what
                    they've learned
                    to any site they work on, be it personal or business.</p>
                <h2>Where You Can Learn And Measure</h2>
                
                <p> After you've launched your site, come back to web.dev and measure how
                    well it
                    supports your users. If there are areas where it can improve, you'll get immediate steps to increase
                    your metrics.
                    As the web advances, users' expectations get higher. With web.dev's guidance, you can give your
                    users
                    the best
                    possible experience, wherever they are!</p>
                <h2> What I Learnt From Here</h2>

                <p> First of all, I recoginzed I have to know users, and I have solutions
                    for their
                    needs. But, to win users' loyalty, I also need to give them the best possible experience with my
                    site.
            </div>
            <h2>The site principles:</h2>

            <ul>

                <li>Find your site</li>
                <li>Open your site from any device</li>
                <li>Load your site on a poor network connection</li>
                <li>Use your site with assistive technology, like a screen reader</li>

            </ul> With web.dev, we can see how my website is performing, and learn tips to improve user experience.
