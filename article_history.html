    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>
      The work on WebDAV started in year 1996 when a phd graduate
      started working with world wide web consortium to discuss the
      problems in WWW(world wide web)'s problems of distributed
      authoring.WWW was made for both reading and editing web pages
      but as time grew it basically became only read only medium. The
      group decided to separate the work of distributed authoring and
      version control.It left the work of version control for fututre
      and concluded its work in 2007
