                <h3>What is a yurt?</h3>
                <p>They are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor
                    and a
                    roof
                    dome that can be opened.</p>
                <h3>How are the yurts furnished?</h3>
                <p>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed down quilt and gas-fired stove. It includes electricity
                    and
                    a sink with hot and cold water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</p>
                    <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
                    <p>A sense of adventure and some time to relax! You should also pack comfortable walking shoes
                        and
                        plan
                        to
                        dress for changing weather with layers of clothing.</p>
